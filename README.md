# Multi-Tenant-M365-Monitoring
Based off of an existing set of script that end up being used as Azure Automation Runbooks. This script was updated to connect to multiple M365 Subscriptions, resolve the default domain of the M365 Tenant; connect to the the Service Health Dashboard and Message centre and send the data to Log Analytics for dashboarding and alerting.
